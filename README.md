Fake 3D environment created using 2D and a technique called Raycasting.

Created with tremendous help from:
[Andor Salga](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/36804)
[Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

A good chunk of the code was borrowed from these sources, and then split and structured.
